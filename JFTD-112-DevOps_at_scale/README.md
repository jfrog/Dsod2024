# JFTD-112 - DevOps at scale

In an increasingly international context, software distribution management poses many challenges when teams are distributed worldwide, particularly in terms of data integrity and business continuity. This workshop will give you the keys to overcoming these difficulties by harnessing the full power of JFrog. We'll look at relevant real-world use cases, such as disaster recovery, robust data federation, distribution strategies, local availability of binary files, centralized access controls and secure architecture design, among others. At the end of this workshop, you will be able to: - design and implement secure, scalable architectures for enterprise-wide deployments, promoting collaboration and efficiency. - exploit JFrog's features to establish robust recovery plans and guarantee data integrity, with a view to ensuring business continuity and reducing the risk of downtime.
